# Hmm...  I'm sure there's some reason this isn't done automatically:
[ -r ~/.bashrc ] && . ~/.bashrc

# Interactive-only setup.  (This is necessary because the gdm
# maintainers don't understand that the idea of a non-interactive
# login shell is nonsensical.)
interactive || return

# Check for mail:
#MAILCHECK=60
# MAILPATH should default to something sensible

# Print out motd if we're in an xterm (and thus login didn't do it for
# us):
[ "$TERM" = "xterm" -a -r /etc/motd ] && cat /etc/motd

# Print out a silly quote:
[ -x /usr/games/fortune ] && ( echo ; /usr/games/fortune )

# Try to update configuration:
#[ -d .config ] && (cd .config && cvs -q update -d)
# (We can't just blindly cd; someone might have symlinked to
# .bash_login but not .config!  I did this when using the cs251
# course account, for example.)
